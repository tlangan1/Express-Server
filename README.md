## Notes

- For information on CORS package for and express look [here](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html).

## Use

- To start the server execute the following command.
  ```bash
  node server.jsf
  ```
- To start the server in debug mode execute the following command.
  ```bash
  node --inspect server.js
  ```
- The server listens on whatever "Wi Fi" address was assigned by the router.
- The server uses a local MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

## CORS

- The server uses the IP address in config.json in the `web_server_url` node to enable CORS requests from the web server.
- See the Documentation README for detailed information.

## Enable https in Express:

- Since https is required to enable web push capability in the web server and mixed http/https would violate Content Security Policy it is implemented in this server.
- To enable https, create an SSL certificate for the IP address on which the server is listening with mkcert.
- See the Documentation README for detailed information.

## Web Push Setup

- To enable web push capability I installed the `web-push` package as follows:
  > npm i web-push

## Routes

- Common route behavior:
  - if the error callback in the database operation is not called the operation it considered successful and the server responds with a response status code of 200, `OK`.

### Get Routes

- To get a list of zero or more objectives, goals, tasks, web push subscriptions, notes, thoughts or a single user login.
  - route: '/[objectives|goals|tasks|subscriptions|notes|thoughts|user_login]?params={"parent_id":0,"completed_items":"no","started_items":"either","deleted_items":"no"}'
  - stored procedure: p_get_items
  - response: A JSON object containing and array of items each containing all the columns in the appropriate table.
- To get one objective, goal or task
  - route: '/[objective|goal|task]?params={"item_id":[integer]}'
  - stored procedure: p_get_items
  - response from database: A JSON object containing all the columns in the appropriate table.
  - response to request: The response from the database.

### Post Routes

- The `POST` routes are named such that the data server can call the correct stored procedure without parsing the JSON data in the body.

#### Add routes

- All the `add` routes result in calling the stored procedure `p_add_item` to which the item type is sent as the first parameter and the JSON body of the post is sent as the second parameter.
- To add an objective, goal or task:
  - route: `/add/[objective|goal|task]`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      parent_id: [0 (for objectives)|positive integer],
      item_name: [string],
      item_description: [string]
    }
    ```
- To add a note to a note:
  - route: `/add/note`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      item_type: ['objective'|'goal'|'task'],
      parent_id: [positive integer],
      note_text: [string]
    }
    ```
- To add a web push subscription `Remember this happens in the service worker`:
  - route: `/add/web_push_subscription`
  - body:
    ```
    {
        endpoint: 'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/fPyXIz1Sics:APA91bHxUDOTegKvpS5EpbG5-2-zyeKoJtd_GnWoe3s9KnueDeBogrSmPPv6o7XRZy3pCtupbpjUVlcvngnFWEra1f9mY0q6f5RH3n7AkFYf8IDjmuBgufzcnCroIlcb4quneIqS0FqP',
        expirationTime: null,
        keys: {
            p256dh: 'BPHuI-JEG2KCvT8xm1nuw1Urz9dNlMrDISWh1hvcuwbniou5iplBXE0aQXtapSFfmN_F2TyjBL8uVNgFVZtVLP4',
            auth: 'FuqWYxSp_dn2Hk5sfefAfA'
        }
    }
    ```
- To add a user_login:
  - route: `/add/user_login`
  - body:
    ```
    {
        user_name: [string],
        password: [string],
        full_name: [string],
        display_name: [string],
        email_address: [string | null]
    }
    ```

#### Update routes

- All the `update` routes result in calling the stored procedure `p_update_item` to which the item type is sent as the first parameter and the JSON body of the post is sent as the second parameter.
- To start, pause, resume or complete a task:
  - route: `/update/task`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      operation_type: [start|pause|resume|complete],
      task_id: <positive integer>,
      user_login_id: <positive integer>,
    }
    ```
- To cancel/delete an objective, goal or task:
  - route: `/update/[objective|goal|task]`
  - body:
    ```
    {
        operation_type: cancel_delete,
        item_id: [positive integer]
        user_login_id: <positive integer>,
    }
    ```

#### Other routes

- To login: Even though this is a `check` route there is no call to a check stored procedure. This is because of the need to protect the clear text password from ever being exposed to the database environment where it might be recorded in a log or a dump or whatever. The checking of the clear text password as presented by the user against the hashed password in the database is all done within the context of an in memory operation in the Express server.
  - route: `/check/user_login`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      user_name: [string],
      password: [string],
    }
    ```
  - stored procedure: `p_get_items`
  - response from database: A JSON object containing all the columns in the user_login table except the hashed_password and deleted_dtm columns.
  - response to request: The JSON object returned from the database.
- This route is used to switch between the life_helper and test_life_helper databases. It is merely for convenience when developing and has no role in a production environment. If I am developing against the test database and something occurs to me that I would like to document in an objective, goal or task in the production database, I can switch data sources momentarily to do so and then switch back without making any configuration changes.
  - route: `/set/data_source`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      database: [string],
    }
    ```
  - stored procedure: N/A
  - response from database: N/A.
  - response to request: 200 or failure.
- `THIS ROUTE DOES NOT YET EXIST AS OF 2/12/2025`: To attach a goal to an existing objective or a task to an existing goal:
  - route: `/attach/[goal|task]`
  - body:
    ```
    {
      parent_id: [positive integer],
      child_id: [positive integer],
    }
    ```
  - stored procedure: `p_attach_item`
  - response from database: `TO DO`
  - response from database: `TO DO`
